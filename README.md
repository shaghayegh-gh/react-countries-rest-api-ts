# Countries App

## About

This project is an example SPA written in `React` with `TypeScript` that shows a list of countries with their details using a public `REST API`. When a country is clicked, the country's detail will be shown. It is possible to search and filter by name or continent. It is possible to toggle between the dark mode and the light mode.

The project uses a public REST API at this address: https://restcountries.com/v2
